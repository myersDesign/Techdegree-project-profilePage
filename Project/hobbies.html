        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>I enjoy training my Dog, Tyson. His training includes voice commands, playing fetch, stimulating his mind with activities and my wallet taking a punch with all of the 
        toys I have to provide.</p>
        <p>I read as much as I can on a daily basis and I attempt to finish one book every month or two.</p>
        <p>I spend a lot of my time working, hanging with friends, video games and developing my skills as an entry level web developer.</p>
